# Quick Node
- QuickNode is a platform which helps you access the blockchain environment without going through the hassle of hosting your own node, saving time and resources
- This platform lets you access blockchain nodes in a few clicks and you can scale the node performance according to your need thus creating an environment for you to scale your DApp.


- Sign up to your Quicknode
- click on create endpoint
- Select Ethereum as Network and Goerli as chain and continue
- We don't need any add-on so click create endpoint now


- Now once you create the endpoint you can start setting up our Metamask Wallet with QuickNode
- Go to your Metamask wallet and click on the list of networks.
- A drop-down list will show up with a list of networks but you need to click on ADD NETWORK at the bottom of the list
- Now you will have a form to fill up to add a new network to your metamask account
- Let's go back to QuickNode Endpoint Dashboard, and copy the HTTPS


- Now let's go back to the Metamask add network form and

- Ethereum Goerli - QuickNode
- Paste the HTTPS in New RPC Url field with 5 as Chain ID, 
- "ETH" as Currency Symbol, 
- Ethereum Goerli as Network Name (Any name as you like) and 
- Finally https://goerli.etherscan.io/ as Block Explorer URL. 
- Click Save

# Get your private MetaMask key
-  While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction.
-  Make private key is not visible
- IF YOUR KEY IS PUBLIC, HACKERS AND STEALERS WILL TAKE ALL YOUR FUND AND EVERYTHING THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ACCOUNT.

# Alchemy also provide Node



# solidity contract
- Node, NPM, VScode

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity

```sh
mkdir Hello-World
cd Hello-World
ls
npm init --yes
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat
```
-  What do you want to do? - Create an empty hardhat.config.js

- hardhat.config.js  file contains solidity version
- Now we will create two directories - contracts & scripts.
- The contracts directory will have all the contracts for the project and scripts directory will have all the deployments scripts and other stuff related to the project.
- The contracts directory will have the contract of your Hello World. Create a HelloWorld.sol file in the contracts folder.

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
 
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;
 
contract HelloWorld {
    //events
    //states
    //functions
 
    event messagechanged(string oldmsg, string newmsg);
 
    string public message;
 
    constructor(string memory firstmessage) {
        message = firstmessage;   
    }
 
    function update(string memory newmesssage) public {
        string memory oldmsg = message;
        message = newmesssage;
 
        emit messagechanged(oldmsg, newmesssage);
     }
}

```

- A smart contract has states, functions and events
- The states are usually variables, tokens, NFTs whose state we want to maintain in the contract.
- In order to read, write or change the states, we use functions.  
- Events are triggers that are activated based on a transformation in a state, a call to a function etc. 
- So our code right now has a state variable called 'message', a function called 'update' and and event called 'messagechanged'.
- code that takes a string when the smart contract is first time executed and if we want we can change that value to a new message as well.

# Deployment
- While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction
- To hide private key using env

```sh
npm install dotenv --save
touch .gitignore
touch .env
```
- All the secrets and important keys related to your project will be stored in .env file
- In the gitignore file we simply write .env, it tells git to ignore that file from future commits.
- Open the .env file you have just created. Add your MetaMask Private Key and Quicknode App HTTP URL there

```env
PRIVATE_KEY = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
API_URL_KEY = YOUR_QUICKNODE_APP_URL
```

```sh
npm i -D @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```
- We will update our hardhat config file to setup Goerli Deployment

```sol
/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
 require('dotenv').config(); //all the key value pairs are being made available due to this lib
 require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
    
 module.exports = {
   solidity: "0.8.17",
   defaultNetwork: 'goerli',
   networks: {
     hardhat: {},
     goerli: {
         url: process.env.API_URL_KEY,
         accounts: [`0x${process.env.PRIVATE_KEY}`]
     }
   }
 };
```

# Deployment Script
- We will create a deploy.js file in the scripts folder and this file will contain all the logic for deployment

```sh
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers
```

- Hardhat ethers is a plugin that gives us access to ethers.js library
- Ethers.js library gives us a way to interact with the blockchain world, we can deploy contracts, we can fetch contracts, we can call their functions.

deploy.js
```js 
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
async function main() {

   const HelloWorld = await ethers.getContractFactory('HelloWorld');

   const hw = await HelloWorld.deploy("Hello World! Bingo");

   console.log('Contract Deployed to:', hw.address);
}

main().then(() => process.exit(0))
.catch(error => {
 console.error(error);
 process.exit(1);
});

```

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

- If all goes well, your contract will be deployed and you will be able to see the address of the contract on the terminal.
- Copy that and save in your .env file with variable name as CONTRACT_ADDRESS, we will use it later to interact with the contract.

> CONTRACT_ADDRESS = YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS

- Etherscan is a website to help you view data regarding any pending or confirmed Ethereum blockchain transactions

https://goerli.etherscan.io/

- Since Ethereum is a public, open blockchain, whenever anyone interacts with it the action is recorded into the transaction history and it is open for anyone to see.


# Interacting with the Deployed Contract
- create a new file interact.js

```js
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
 
const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY; //get from alchemy
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = process.env.CONTRACT_ADDRESS; //deployed contract address
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY; //metamask
 
const contract = require('../artifacts/contracts/HelloWorld.sol/HelloWorld.json');
 
// provider - Alchemy
const alchemyProvider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider(network="goerli", API_KEY);
 
// signer - you
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, alchemyProvider);
 
// contract instance
const helloWorldContract = new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, contract.abi, signer);
 
async function main() {
 
    const message = await helloWorldContract.message();
    console.log("the message is "+ message);
 
    const tx = await helloWorldContract.update("Good Bye, World!");
    await tx.wait();
 
    const nmessage = await helloWorldContract.message();
    console.log("the new message is "+ nmessage);
}
 
main()
.then(() => process.exit(0))
.catch(error => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

- Quick Node and Ether
- - const API_URL_KEY = process.env.API_URL_KEY;
- - const alchemyProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(API_URL_KEY);


- Ether.js library gives us providers
- interface for our interaction with the Ethereum Blockchain nodes
- When a request is made, it is sent to multiple backends simultaneously
- As responses from each backend are returned, they are checked that they agree
- the response is provided to your application

- Signers is an abstraction of an ethereum account
- The signers can be used to sign messages and transactions which can result in calling function, changing state variables etc
- Here we are sharing our account private key, because we are the signers of this transaction. 

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/interact.js --network goerli
```
